Yesterday, I got a sunburn.
It was the 6th of February, and I got a sunburn, here, in London. No need to say that the weather on this first Sunday of February was utterly insane: 23° Celsius at noon, sun beating down all day, not the slightest wind gust. And of course, the festivities planned for this day were coming up against the outstanding unusuality of temperatures. The London’s municipality, big brands looking for some visibility and private promoters had all been preparing their Feb6 events for 4 months, summoning all their creativity to attract both Londoners and tourists, who had been flowing in for this special day. This morning newscast was claiming that the population of London had almost doubled over the weekend.</br>
A while later, I even heard that there had been more weddings celebrated in London yesterday than for the last 6 months. Obviously, every single priest in the London area had already been booked for months and the few remaining ones in the priest pool had ingeniously started raising their fees. The divine law of supply and demand, right? People went crazy, offering more and more money to get one of the last available priests so they could celebrate their wedding on this very particular Sunday. The Church ended up officially condemning the priest-auction and organized a lottery to assign the last churchmen to requesting couples. The day after, tons of ads started emerging on Craigslist: individuals were calling themselves priests and offering their churchy skills for indecent amounts of money. Not sure Jesus would have approved though... This is basically all I know on this wedding matter since it hit the news in December or so, but yesterday this gloomy story came back to my mind while spotting newly married rich couples cruising down London in convertible limos.</br>
And the most surprising thing about that glorious Sunday was that everyone had been expecting it...with utter certainty.</br></br>
It has now been more than 2 years since IBM came up with their Atmos supercomputer, and I’m still having a hard time accepting the changes it initiated. Of course, at first there was a huge and global euphoria. IBM announced in a press conference that they had built a computer that included something like one processor per cubic millimeter of air in the atmosphere that was fetching data from a huge swarm of satellites in real time. Anyway, most people including myself didn’t really care about the technical amazingness of this announcement, but only focused on this very
sentence from the company’s CEO: “As of now, we know with a precision that can be considered to be 100% what the weather will be like anywhere anytime for the 30 years to come.”.</br>
IBM had done it. They had modelized the atmosphere so precisely that they were now able to say at what minute of the day rain would start falling on Victoria Park in 1500 days from now. All around the world, people were euphoric; on a symbolic point of view, the humanity had gone even further in controlling and predicting nature. The weather forecast problem had been going on for millenniums and now it was solved, end of story. Sure, these were challenging times for weathercasters, who had just lost their job in the timeframe of one single sentence. But for 99.9% of humanity, this was good news. This was Progress. We were able to say when long droughts, bad harvests and famines would happen and thus act accordingly in all countries of the Third World. Same thing for hurricanes, floods, storms. All these things had become entirely predictable and lives could be saved. Awesome.</br>
But soon after came the business model. IBM would give away weather knowledge for the entire year to come, and each year they would release the forecast for the following one. To get more long-term data, one had to pay. A lot.</br></br>
For most people, one year was well enough. For governments, insurance companies and NGOs however, it clearly was not. For instance, a small country needed to know more in order to invest peacefully in sustainable infrastructures. Was it worth it to build this dike against floods? Or these hurricane resistant roofs? A single year of knowledge was too little to be sure that building this infrastructure would be more profitable than just evacuating endangered cities from time to time. And thus, the weather inequalities began. The first ones to purchase data were insurance companies. This breakthrough was a miracle for these kinds of business: for most of them, it was totally worth it to invest in this precious information. Naturally, IBM had developed a very complicated encryption system to be sure this data could not be stolen, and they’d done it well. They already had a quantum computer running at the time, so for sure their encryption system was safe. Besides, they had used a block chain technology so that every chunk of data carried in its core the identity of who had purchased it. Thus, if a chunk of data was shared illegally somewhere, one would have known from which company the leak was coming by looking directly at the data.</br>
After a few months, very specific countries of the Third World started being deserted by the biggest investors that undoubtedly had access to the weather data. Due to global climate changes, many poor countries were already subject to natural catastrophes like hurricanes, floods or droughts, but the fact that suddenly a very specific subset of those countries was massively deserted by multinationals was a bad sign. Their inhabitants were left with the guessing that bad climate events would occur in a near future, but without knowing neither what exactly nor when. Could be in 5 years, or in 20. People started freaking out: the lack of information was creating doubts and rumors were spreading fast. It was even worse than if nobody had known anything in the first place. The smaller investors, even if they couldn’t afford the weather data, were relying on the behavior of multinational firms and thus following the lead. If all these guys don’t want to go there, they should have good reasons, right? Already poor countries were becoming even poorer, with anxious populations. In a cruel irony, climate refugees started flowing in the Northern Hemisphere even though no climate catastrophe had happened yet.</br></br>
On this other side of the world, in the Western World, things were ok. I mean, at first, it didn’t change my daily routine that much. The yearly iOS update merged the Calendar and the Weather apps, and that was pretty much it. Weather was now an inherent feature of days, and to be honest, I got used to it quite rapidly. We all did. Now it even seems weird remembering that just a few years ago we had no certain knowledge about tomorrow’s weather. This feels so prehistoric sometimes. But on the other hand, it wasn’t such a great revolution either. Sure, it was fairly nice to know exactly what to wear on the next day, but nothing vital here. More convenient was the ability to know what kind of clothes to bring on holidays.</br>
Speaking of which, the traditional holiday planning arrived in companies like mine, and in March the HR department asked us to schedule our days off, for organizational sake. And inevitably, since all of us had access to the sacrosanct weather forecast, everybody asked for the exact same days. Most people in the company would spend their holidays in London, or would go to some places around Europe, and nobody wanted to spend the holidays in pouring rain.</br>
Different policies started to emerge: the most ethical companies would organize random draws so it would be as fair as possible for their employees, but this applied mostly to small companies or companies without a prominent hierarchy. Most others started attributing priority levels to their employees: my company decided for example to include the number of sunny days off available per year for each employee in their contract. The definition of what a sunny day was could vary from one enterprise to another, but in mine it was something like a day has at least 95% of sunlight during daytime. The most responsibilities you had in the company, the more sunny days off you could get. Companies were also using the amount of these special days as an attractive bait to recruit someone for an open position. Instead of increasing the wage, you could negotiate one or two more sunny days off. Talk about a deal.</br></br>

For an unexpected factor soon came into play: everything was more expensive when the sun was shining. Since it was now possible for every business to know which days would drain more people out of their homes, they started making business plans out of it. Two price ranges found their ways on bars and restaurant menus: sunny prices, and normal prices. This “weather business” practice spread out into every single country where the weather was fluctuating enough. In London, it became especially awful; prices could vary by twice as much whether it was freezing cold or pleasantly warm. Therefore, you had to take that into account if your plans were to hang out in town on your days off. Taking too many sunny days could become pricey if you wanted to do something else than just staying at home. On sunny days, bars and restaurant with terrace, swimming pools, amusement parks became more and more costly, while movie theaters, museums, and other indoor places lowered their prices to attract more people.</br>
Gradually, sunlight was becoming a luxury good in all Western countries. Nobody was complaining of course, it made perfect sense from a business point of view. Moreover, poor people had enough to complain about not to raise the issue of sunlight equality. Sunny days were not considered as basic commodities, and therefore it was totally ok for them to be accessible only by the wealthiest. By the way, I guess you can already imagine how the tourism industry changed overnight. Even for the middle class, spending a week in the sun somewhere on the Atlantic coast was now unaffordable, although anyone lucky could have enjoyed it a few years ago. Flight tickets, accommodation, hotels, cars rentals, bars and restaurant, all those services were doubling and sometimes tripling their rates with the sun. That was particularly true for places where nice weather was rare and valuable – like Ireland or skiing areas. People made all kind of calculations to optimize the percentage of sunny days they wanted for their holidays and the money they were willing to spend on them. Was it worth it to get very low prices by spending a whole week in the rain? Some people certainly thought it was. Weird times...</br></br>
Anyway, yesterday, as I was walking through Victoria Park under a radiant sun, I was surprised to see a small assembly of young folks, maybe not more than 50 of them, demonstrating in the park against this weather-super-knowledge thing, kindly asking IBM to shut down their supercomputer. Well, good luck with that. I think they were calling themselves Anti-Atmosists or something. On their signs, one could read: “All men are created equals in regard to a bloody rain.”
